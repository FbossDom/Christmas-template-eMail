# Christmas-template-eMail
Productional process of an email creation - simulated


1. I went out to find a psd file // From: https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/email-templates-campaign-monitor/
2. I exported images from the psd using gimp.
3. I built the email to support all email clients
  - Dark mode compatible
  - Accesability was considered
4. Tested the email in
  - Gmail(windows web, android web, android app)
  - Yahoo(windows web, android web, android app)
  - Outlook(windows web, android web, android app)
